# [GwG Project #1: Builer a Portfolio Site](https://github.com/tyler-vs/gwg-project-1-portfolio-site)

My project submission for the first project in the <abbr title="Grow With Google">GWG</abbr> Udacity Nanodegree program. The project was built on top of the popular [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and was influenced by popular responsive CSS frameworks like [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). To reduce total `HTTP` requests needed, I combined my own project styles from the [`custom-v2.css`](css/custom-v2.css) file into the main stylesheet ([`main.css`](css/main.css)) file used in the [`index.html`](index.html).

## Built With

- [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) - The web framework used
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) - Prototyping
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets
